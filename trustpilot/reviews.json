Alignment was performed but steering angle still feels off, with no alignment sheet given to show what car was aligned at.  Was told it would be sent over to me and never was.  Car was tuned by Racingline on the dyno and returned throwing error codes and was returned twice to try to have the problem solved and had to be returned to stock, response was \"well its been fine for us we don't know what to tell you\". Not the type of response you want to hear when someone is doing performance work, makes you believe they are unsure of what they are doing. It was a very frustrating way to spend $2100 and not be satisfied in the end especially not to have documentationfor the alignment or dyno sheet usage.

Price and delivery were fine, and cover seems fine, but it was smaller than I expected.  I bought the 16 X 32 pool size, but was expecting the cover to substantially overlap (by a foot or two) the actual pool.  That is how our last cover fit, which came from the previous homeowner.  It overlaps the pool and we place some bricks around the periphery to hold it down.  Because this new cover fits \"inside the pool\", it is much more difficult to get the leaves, sticks, insects, and insect waste off the cover and keep it out of the pool.  We are completely surrounded by large mature trees, and this is a problem.
